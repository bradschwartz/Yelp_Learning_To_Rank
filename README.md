# Learning to Rank on the Yelp Dataset

## Idea
We can train machine learning algorithms to _score_ businesses based on the data
about them. This data is mostly reviews, rankings, photos and their captions,
and tips, all provided by users of Yelp.

## ML
Will explore unsupervised and supervised techniques.

### Supervised
1. Support Vector Machines
2. Decision Trees

### Unsupervised
1. K-means clustering
2. Artificial Neural Networks
