# Can join tip on user_id and business_id
# 


'''
Schemas
tip: text(str), date(str, yyyy-mm-dd), likes(int), business_id(str), user_id(str)
business: business_id, name, neighborhood, address, city, state, postal code(str),
	latitude, longitude, stars, review_count, is_open(int), attributes : {mostly accessibility info},



Idea for feature vector: Use all categories possible, populating with reals not binaries
as often as possible.
